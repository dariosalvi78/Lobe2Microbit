Lobe to MicroBit
================

Dead simple example of integration between the image recongition sowtware [Lobe](https://www.lobe.ai/) and [Microbit](https://microbit.org/).
It's a webpage that loads a model produced by Lobe and sends recognised labels to a serial interface, which can be plugged to a Microbit, but also any other device really.

## Why?

Why not?

The idea is to test possible integrations of Machine Learning with embedded devices, such as Arduino and Microbit.

## How?

1. Train a model with Lobe.
2. Export your model as a Tensorflow.JS example
3. Copy the content of the folder that you have just exported into the
